# FileHandler-with-PHP
<p>File handler libarary will help developers to fasten the way they handle file, You can make a web application with file upload in few lines using this library</p>

<p>I use traits also together with FileHandler class, well PHP does not support multiple inheritance so i created Error.php trait to handle the setting and getting error messages</p>
